Not all things are instantly successful or happen when they should. That's definitely the case here. This is perhaps something that should have happened a decade ago, but "better late than never". Right?

Life is learning. That's what I plan on doing for a long time. Right now it's learning to live the life of a software developer. I can write code. But can I develop and contribute in such a way that makes me a desirable developer? My intention is to soon be able to answer that with a resounding "yes."

Learning takes time. As I explore writing code, or a blog, I get glimpses of what I don't know. These glimpses are doorways to my unknowns and are key to expanding myself. Walking through these doorways forces me to learn. Running through the doorway means I have to learn faster.

Consistency is key. To be considered an expert, I understand, a person needs to spend 10,000 hours on a subject. This happens to equate to just shy of five years of work in a full-time job. It's the day-in-day-out of performing a task that cements the knowledge and skills. To this end I've worked toward writing code or thinking about code on a daily basis.

Fail, but keep trying. I failed to get into development years ago and became discouraged. I have the ability, I just need to learn and start practicing the daily habits of good, no, awesome developers. That is what I will become; an awesome developer.

The future is what you make it. I will be grasping code by the horns and riding until I break into development.
